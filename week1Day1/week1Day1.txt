What is Java?
 *Java is a programming language used to create software applications, including web and mobile apps.
 *Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it organizes code into reusable components
  called objects. 
 Objects can contain both data(variable) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.
 *Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making them portable.
 *Code written in Java can be run on different devices without modification.
 * Java has a large and active community of developers worldwide.

Java Architecture:

 JVM: Java Virtual Machine
 JRE: Java Runtime Environment
 JDK:Java Development Kit

JVM is the virtual machine that executes Java bytecode.
JRE is the runtime environment that includes the JVM and libraries needed to run Java applications.
JDK is the development kit that includes the JRE along with development tools for writing, compiling, and running Java programs.



IDE: Integrated Development Environment
Definition: An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is like a digital workspace where programmers write, edit, and
 manage their code. It provides tools such as a code editor, debugger, and compiler, all in one place,
  making it easier for developers to create and maintain their software.
